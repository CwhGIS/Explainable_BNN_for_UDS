# Explainable_BNN_for_UDS

This repository contains the code for the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) model that is discussed in our paper submitted to the Journal of Hydrology. It also includes the application of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpretability.

## Contents

- BNN implementation: Code for constructing and training the Bayesian Neural Network.
- SHAP analysis: Scripts for applying SHAP values to interpret the BNN model.

## Usage

Instructions on how to use the BNN code and conduct SHAP analysis will be provided in a future update.


## Contact

For any immediate questions regarding the project, please note that responses will be delayed. Full contact details will be provided with the forthcoming update.
